# storystitch — project setup

Web-only product: no API, database or backend. All image processing runs in the browser.

## Services and URLs

| | Local | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger | `pnpm dev` | merge to `main` (CI deploys) | `/release` → `production` branch |
| Web | http://localhost:5173 | https://main.storystitch-web.pages.dev | https://storystitch-web.pages.dev |

- GitHub: https://github.com/ashishnag124/storystitch (private)
- Cloudflare Pages project: `storystitch-web` (classic Pages, Direct Upload; production branch `production`)
- Production shows "Deployment Not Found" until the first `/release`.

## Where config lives

| Value | Where | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | GitHub secrets (loaded from `~/.config/new-project/secrets.env`) | `_deploy-pages.yml` |
| `PAGES_PROJECT` = `storystitch-web` | GitHub variable | `ci.yml`, `release.yml` |

There are no app config values yet; `.env.example` is empty.

## Open checklist

- [ ] Protect the `production` branch (GitHub → Settings → Branches). Needs GitHub Pro or a public repo; the release workflow works without it, it just isn't enforced.
- [ ] Before the first release: check staging by hand on a real phone (iPhone Safari and Android Chrome).
- [ ] Cloudflare is moving Pages into Workers: Wrangler 4.156 delegated `pages project create` to Workers and it failed, so this project was created with `--force` as classic Pages. If `wrangler pages deploy` in CI starts failing the same way, the deploy setup needs revisiting.
- [ ] Custom domain (later): add it to the Pages project and CNAME `staging.` → `main.storystitch-web.pages.dev`.

## Release

Run `/release` in Claude Code from this repo. It checks CI on `main`, shows what's shipping and the manual acceptance checks, asks for confirmation, then runs the Release workflow. That workflow re-runs `pnpm qa` (every criterion in `docs/acceptance-criteria.md`) on the exact commit, and only if it passes fast-forwards `production`, tags `vX.Y.Z` and deploys the web app to production. The QA report is attached to the run as the `qa-results-vX.Y.Z` artifact.

## Add an app or service

Run `/add-app` (e.g. an iOS app, API + database, accounts). It updates `project.json`, CI and release.

## Rollback

- Web: Cloudflare dashboard → Workers & Pages → `storystitch-web` → Deployments → roll back to a previous production deployment. Then fix forward on `main` and `/release` again.
- There is no database, so there are no migrations to roll back.
